Now that repository is created:
how to check hidden files?

ls -la // means list everything	


1. make a file.txt and type something

/*TWO STEP PROCESS*/

2. git add . 				//add all the changes we made to our project/repository -- now it knows we added a file to our folder

					/*whenever you are making a commit, you are telling git to save this point in time - or taking a snapshot*/

3. git commit -m  "type any message here which describes what changes you made"
