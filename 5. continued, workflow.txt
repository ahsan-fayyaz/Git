after adding the two new files, both of them weren't being tracked by git

our two new files had names project2 and project 3

-how to add those so git can track them?


process: working area > staging area > repository

-command = git add project2.txt
/*this will send the files to staging area, there you can 
git commit -m "message" to add them to repository*/

-command = git status: 	it shows that project2.txt not committed yet
			also shows project3.txt is not added yet

-command = git commit -m "adding second file"
/*what it does is that whatever is in staging area (project2.txt) it just pushes that into repository*/





HOWEVER, the project3.txt is still sitting there if you type git status because it wasn't added

-command = git add project3.txt /*now its in staging area*/
-command = git commit -m "committing the third file"  


use git status to check
