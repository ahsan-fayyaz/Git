how to check changes between your working files and the changes saved in the git repository

for example:
go to project1.txt
make changes.

and now the changes in working are different from the ones you committed to git repository.. how to view them?

- command = git status
- command = git diff
/*will show what exact changes are between working file and committed to repository
red one = the changes committed
green 	= the changes you made to working file */


-command = git add project1.txt
-command = git commit -m "type a message here"  // changes committed


-command = git diff

no changes appear	



WHAT IF WE MADE CHANGES TO project2.txt and project3.txt at the same time?


git status
git diff // check the changes

git add .
git commit -m "type message"
