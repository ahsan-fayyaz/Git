now we make changes to project1.txt
update it with more text.

how to tell git that this is the new file we want in our project now


-command = git status
/*it shows that the project1.txt file is modified*/


-command = git add project1.txt /*added to staging area, ready to be committed*/
-command = git commit -m "this is the second commit to project1.txt"
/*now git has access to the latest */




NOW MAKE CHANGES TO project2.txt and project3.txt
how to commit both at same time?

-command = git add .
/*add all the files to the staging area*/

-command = git commit -m "this is how you commit mutiple files at the same time"
