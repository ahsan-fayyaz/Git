suppose:  rename the file project1.txt --> home.txt

run git status: git says you removed project1.txt, and made a new file home.txt
/*just another way to check things*/


run git add home.txt
run git rm project1.txt

run git status
/*now it realizes its only the name that changed*/

run git commit -m "just renamed the file"


----there is an easy way to rename files-----


moving means same as renaming the files in git

run git mv project2.txt pudding.txt
/*it is same as renaming project2 to pudding.txt*/






----Create a folder named LoveNotes inside the current directory----
----need to move pudding.txt to LoveNotes director----
----at the same time also rename the pudding.txt file to patty.txt----


git mv pudding.txt LoveNotes/patty.txt
